To RUN THE EXPERIMENT open THE INDEX.HTML FILE IN THE CODES FOLDER.


Some of the libraries are included from cdn and others are in the Libraries folder.

PROGRESS TILL NOW:

FRONT-END: Created the structure USING HTML,CSS,BOOTSTRAP.

Grid is also created using Jointjs whose dependecies has been included in the Libraries folder.

I also has given the Example of hello world in the experiment.
