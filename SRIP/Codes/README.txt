To RUN THE EXPERIMENT open THE INDEX.HTML FILE IN THE CODES FOLDER.

I removed the import_it button cause it just add a block of the circuit which i have included in the toolbar which is on the left side.

first select the circuit diagram you want to include then click on the load_it for upload the circuit on the board.

clear functionality is also added.

load and import button are also there to include a file.

for other button the work is on progress.
